          <h1>Alexis Youngbar</h1>
          <p>When I was little I always wanted to be an artist, I started 
            drawing and painting around 6 years old! Little did I know I 
            would eventually end up in Ux Ui design. While yes it is art, 
            it is also a lot of research which I find interesting. I love 
            being able to take my research from creating interview plans, 
            interviewing users, affinity diagrams, proto personas, ideation 
            I like, I wish, I want), and making priority matrixes, to come 
            up with ideas on how my designs would best suit my users.

    <h1>User Empathy</h1>
    <p>When I try to empathize with my users, I make an empathy map, I do ideation, and I make a priority 
      matrix about what would be important for them and/also the company.

    <h1>User Testing</h1>
    <p>I draw and sketch wireframe ideas on pencil and paper. I take my ideas and put them 
      onto Adobe XD or Figma to create a low fidelity prototype. I gather users to try out my prototype 
      to find any pain points or any insights.
